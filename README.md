The Circuit is a popular "Groovebox" by Novation.

It stores information about synths, samples and sequencer patterns in downloadable SysEx files. This project aims to provide a tool for extracting data from these files.

Sadly, until now Novation has only released official information about their synth patch format. This is why most of the formats have to be reversed engineered.
